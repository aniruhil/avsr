        <p>I am an Associate Professor of Leadership and Public Affairs @ Ohio University’s <a href="http://www.ohio.edu/voinovichschool/">Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs</a> who also directs the <a href="http://bit.ly/Hia5mz">Honors Tutorial College/Voinovich Scholars Program</a> (a rewarding applied research program enrolling some of Ohio University’s most promising students interested in leadership and public affairs), and is the <a href="http://oerc.osu.edu/">Ohio Education Research Center‘s (OERC)</a> Co-Principal Investigator/Co-Site Lead at Ohio University (with Marsha S. Lewis). I teach quantitative research methods, policy analysis, and (occasionally) program evaluation for the Voinovich School’s Master of Public Administration (MPA/OEMPA) academic programs. I earn my daily wage as a quantitative research methodologist/applied statistician for the School.</p>

<p>
Since joining Ohio University in 2005, I have worked on several evaluations of programs\policies involving value-added analysis (for <a href="http://www.battelleforkids.org/">Battelle for Kids</a>), issues of post-secondary access and success in Appalachia (led by Marsha S. Lewis), public health surveys and reports targeting diabetes in multiple Appalachian counties of the state, and a number of other interesting projects. Some of the more fascinating projects I am currently juggling (again with Marsha S. Lewis) include a comprehensive study of Ohio’s new Teacher (<a href="http://1.usa.gov/HialSF">OTES</a>) and Principal (<a href="http://1.usa.gov/Hiaqpi">OPES</a>) evaluation systems, and some data analytics for <a href="https://www.ohiohealth.com/">OhioHealth</a>.</p>

<p>
Along with various reports co-authored for grant-\contract-funded projects I have published on issues of race and representation in local America, on state politics and policy, and on urban governance. This work appears in the pages of the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, State Politics and Policy Quarterly, Policy Studies Journal, Urban Affairs Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Social Science Quarterly, the American Journal of Health Behavior, the Journal of Rural Health, and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.</p>
