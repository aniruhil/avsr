        <p>I am an Associate Professor of Leadership and Public Affairs @ Ohio University’s Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs who also directs (with Holly Craycraft) the Honors Tutorial College/Voinovich Scholars Program (a rewarding applied research program enrolling some of Ohio University’s most promising undergraduate students interested in leadership and public affairs). I teach quantitative research methods, policy analysis, and (occasionally) program evaluation for the Voinovich School’s Master of Public Administration (MPA/OEMPA) academic programs, and serve as a quantitative research methodologist/data analyst for the School.</p>


<p>Since joining Ohio University in 2005, I have worked on several evaluations of programs\policies involving value-added analysis (for Battelle for Kids), a multi-year study of post-secondary access and success in Appalachia (led by Marsha S. Lewis), public health surveys and reports targeting diabetes in multiple Appalachian counties of the state, and several other projects. Some of the more interesting projects I am now juggling (again with Marsha S. Lewis) include a comprehensive study of Ohio’s new Teacher (OTES) and Principal (OPES) evaluation systems while also working on some data analytics for OhioHealth. Data visualization, especially with RStudio’s Shiny, is something else I am trying to add to my toolbox, working with Danielle Keeton-Olsen and Abdalah Elbarrad — two gifted and data-curious students.</p>


<p>Along with various reports co-authored for grant-\contract-funded projects I have published widely on issues of race and representation in local America, on state politics and policy, and on urban governance. This work appears in the pages of the American Political Science Review, the American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, State Politics and Policy Quarterly, Policy Studies Journal, Urban Affairs Review, Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Social Science Quarterly, the American Journal of Health Behavior, the Journal of Rural Health, and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.</p>
