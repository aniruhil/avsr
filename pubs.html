<p> 2014. "Associations Between Preoperative Physical Therapy and Post-Acute Care Utilization Patterns and Cost in Total Joint Replacement." Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, 96(19):e165. (with Richard Snow, Jaymes Granata, Karen Vogel, Michael McShane, Ray Wasielewski) (download) </p>

<pre>Health-care costs following acute hospital care have been identified as a major contributor to regional variation in Medicare spending. This study investigated the associations of preoperative physical therapy and post-acute care resource use and its effect on the total cost of care during primary hip or knee arthroplasty.Historical claims data were analyzed using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Limited Data Set files for Diagnosis Related Group 470. Analysis included descriptive statistics of patient demographic characteristics, comorbidities, procedures, and post-acute care utilization patterns, which included skilled nursing facility, home health agency, or inpatient rehabilitation facility, during the ninety-day period after a surgical hospitalization. To evaluate the associations, we used bivariate and multivariate techniques focused on post-acute care use and total episode-of-care costs.</pre>


<p>2013 "Are We There Yet? The Voting Rights Act and Black Representation on City Councils, 1981–2006" Journal of Politics, 75(4):993-1008. (with Paru R. Shah and Melissa J. Marschall) (download) </p>

Sound evidence demonstrating what, if any, role the Voting Rights Act (VRA) has played in the impressive gains minorities have made in local office holding over the last 45 years remains in short supply. The present study is motivated by three crucial questions. First, where are gains in minority office holding most apparent, and how are these gains related to the VRA? Second, while studies have noted gains in black representation over time, the question of how the VRA in particular has contributed to these gains remains unclear. Finally, given claims made by opponents of the 2006 legislation reauthorizing the VRA that it was no longer needed, the question of when the VRA has been most efficacious, and if it continues to be relevant, is also salient. Our findings suggest that the VRA has been and continues to be an important tool in ensuring black descriptive representation, particularly in places with a legacy of racial intimidation and discrimination.

2012 “Predictors of Successful Diabetes Self-Management in Appalachian Ohio” American Journal of Health Behavior, 36(2):193-202. (with Holly Raffle, Lezlee J. Ware, Sharon Denham, and Jane Hamel-Lambert)  (download)

Objective: To determine factors contributing to successful diabetes self-management in Appalachia, as evidenced by daily blood glucose monitoring. Methods: A telephone survey (N=3841) was conducted to assess health status and health care access. The current investigation is limited to the subset of this sample who report having diabetes (N=529). Results: A multivariate logistic regression model established that having attended a diabetes education class (P<.01) was the most significant predictor of successful diabetes self-management. The inability to pay for care, demographic variables, and health risk indicators were not found to be significantly related to self-management. Conclusions: This study identifies the role of education in successful diabetes self-management for patients in the Appalachian region.

2010 "The New Racial Calculus: Electoral Institutions and Black Representation in Local Legislatures" American Journal of Political Science, 54(1):107-24. (with Melissa J. Marschall and Paru R. Shah)  (download)

In this study we revisit the question of black representation on city councils and school boards using a novel substantive and methodological approach and longitudinal data for a sample of over 300 boards and councils. Conceptualizing black representation as a two-stage process, we fit Mullahy’s hurdle Poisson models to explain whether and to what extent blacks achieve representation in local legislatures. We find that while the size of the black population and electoral arrangements matter more than ever, especially for overcoming the representational hurdle, the extent to which the black population is concentrated is also strongly associated with black council representation. Further, whereas black resources and opportunities to build “rainbow” coalitions with Latinos or liberal whites are marginally if at all related to black legislative representation, we find that legislative size is an underappreciated mechanism by which to increase representation, particularly in at-large systems, and is perhaps the best predictor of moving towards additional representation.

2009 "High Self-Reported Prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Disease, and Stroke in 11 Counties of Rural Appalachian Ohio" The Journal of Rural Health, 25(2):226-230. (with Frank Schwartz; Jay Shubrook, Chris Simpson; and Sara L. Boyd).  (download)

Context/Purpose: There is an epidemic of obesity and diabetes in the United States, especially in economically at-risk populations such as rural Appalachia. This survey determined the self-reported prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and associated macrovascular complications in 11 rural counties of Appalachian Ohio. The impacts of lifestyle, cardiovascular risk factors, income, and access to medical care were also determined. Methods: A telephone survey identical to the 2004 Behavioral Risk  Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey was conducted. Surveys were collected from 3,927 randomly selected residents 18 years of age and older in 11 counties of Appalachian Ohio and compared to published aggregate Ohio and national 2004 BRFSS data. Findings: The self-reported prevalence of diabetes (11.3%) was markedly higher in Appalachian Ohio counties surveyed compared to aggregate Ohio (7.8%) or national (7.2%) 2004 BRFSS data (P < .044). The prevalence of heart disease (7.6%) and stroke (4.1%) in these counties was slightly higher than aggregate Ohio or national 2004 BRFSS data. In persons with diabetes, the prevalence of heart disease was 2-fold higher (20.0%) and stroke 3-fold higher (11.4%) than among nondiabetics (P < .042) in the region and higher than aggregate Ohio and National 2004 BRFSS data. Lower-income levels and decreased access to medications and glucose monitoring supplies correlated with the increased risk for cardiovascular complications in this rural population (P < .042). Conclusion: The self-reported prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its associated macrovascular complications are much higher in rural Appalachian Ohio compared to aggregate Ohio and National 2004 BRFSS data.

2007  "Substantive Symbols: The Attitudinal Dimension of Black Political Incorporation In Local Government" American Journal of Political Science, 51(1):17-33. (with Melissa J. Marschall)  (download)

Traditional studies of minority incorporation focus on the redistribution of public resources that purportedly follows black gains in representation. The present study departs from this approach by focusing on the attitudinal effects of black leadership. Two research questions guide this study: To what extent do blacks’ assessments of neighborhood services and conditions stem from black representation in local executive and legislative offices? Are these attitudinal effects rooted in policy and service delivery outcomes? Employing survey data from 3,000 blacks embedded in 52 cities and 53 school districts, this study reveals that blacks report higher levels of satisfaction with their neighborhood conditions, police services, and public schools when represented by blacks in city hall and on school boards and that these evaluations are most positive when improvements in local services are conspicuous. Overall, these findings extend conventional conceptualizations of substantive benefits and challenge more pessimistic accounts regarding the effects of black representation in local politics.

2006 "The Pomp of Power: Black Mayoralties in Urban America, 1971-2000" Social Science Quarterly, 87(4):828-50. (with Melissa J. Marschall).  (download)

Objectives. Although urban scholarship has come to better understand the dynamics of black political incorporation in the United States, to date scant empirical attention has been paid to an important element of minority representation in local politics—the rise of black mayors. The present study addresses this gap in the extant literature. Methods. We analyze incidences of black mayoralties by fitting standard pooled and random effects probit models to a panel of 309 cities observed between 1971 and 2000. Results. Although cities’ racial profiles are strongly associated with the incidence of black mayoralties, black representation on city council, black educational attainment, and reformed governments increase the odds of black mayoral emergence. On the other hand, southern location continues to depress the rise of black mayoralties, as do partisan elections, particularly in cities where no racial group constitutes a majority. Conclusions. Although our results partially confirm extant research on the diffusion of black mayoralties in American urban politics, they also call into question conventional wisdom. Our study emphasizes the need for more large-N studies of minority representation in urban politics and provides suggestions for how the independent effects of black mayors on municipal policy outcomes might subsequently be analyzed empirically.

2005 "Fiscal Effects of the Voter Initiative Reconsidered: Addressing Endogeneity." State Politics and Policy Quarterly, 5(4):327-55. (with Melissa J. Marschall).  (download)

Several recent studies have investigated the relationship between direct democracy and public policy outcomes, with mixed findings. These inconsistencies may stem, in part, from researchers’ failure to recognize that direct democracy institutions are distributed nonrandomly across the American states. That is, certain factors may lead a state to adopt the initiative process and influence other policy choices. We revisit the question of how the initiative influences state fiscal policy using panel data from 1960–2000 and a full-information maximum likelihood estimator that explicitly accounts for the endogeneity of the initiative. Our findings suggest that failure to endogenize the initiative in empirical analyses leads to substantially biased estimates of its effects. In particular, we find that once factors that predict whether a state has adopted the initiative are controlled, the initiative has a positive effect on state revenue generation and spending.

2003 "Urban Armageddon or Politics as Usual? The Case of Municipal Civil Service Reform." American Journal of Political Science 37(1):159-70.  (download)

For the better part of the twentieth century, the question of municipal reformism has drawn urban scholarship: Why do some cities change their governing arrangements while others do not? Focusing exclusively on merit systems, in this study I expose the political underpinnings of merit reform in American municipal history. A duration analysis of merit adoptions in a sample of 252 cities in the 1900-1940 period suggests that both state- (home rule status, state merit systems) and city-specific (at-large elections, term length, city size, percent foreign-born, regional location) factors largely determined when and where reform occurred.

The political and policy impacts of alternative governing arrangements are an enduring and important puzzle of urban politics. Locating the source of the empirical confusion over structural effects in the use of static data analysis, the author emphasizes the benefits of investigating the substantive consequences of identifiable events (e.g., changes in form of government, budgeting techniques, the election of a minority mayor) via dynamic multiwave panel data and appropriate estimation techniques. This point is illustrated by analyzing the fiscal effects of reformism in a panel of 222 cities (1946-1966). Findings suggest no more than transient decreases in per-capita city expenditures post-adoption of council-manager government.

2003 "What Lies Beneath: Politics and State Merit Systems, 1900-1939." Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory 13(1):27-42. (with Pedro Jorge Camoes).  (download)

The history of the rise and diffusion of the merit principle in American government is common lore to students of public administration and political science. Several descriptive accounts notwithstanding, scholars have ignored an intriguing puzzle vis-à-vis state merit adoptions: Why did some states adopt merit systems early in the twentieth century while other states followed suit decades later, and then only when they were forced to do so by the federal government? When we analyze state merit adoptions that occurred between 1900 and 1939 we find nationwide and state-specific demographic, economic, structural,and political factors—for example, growth in patronage constituencies; the use of the Australian ballot; political party competition; dwindling patronage resources post-Pendleton;and the onset of the Great Depression—that shifted politicians' preferences for the merit principle rather than patronage. Our research thus breaks sharply with the extant literature by emphasizing the political undercurrents of merit reform.

2003 "Institutions, Bureaucratic Decisions, and Policy Outcomes: State Insurance Solvency Regulation." Policy Studies Journal 31(3):353-72. (with Paul Teske).  (download)

Although over the past 2 decades several scholars have documented a link between institutional arrangements and policy choices, few studies have demonstrated how different institutional arrangements give rise to different policy outcomes. Further, although some studies have related bureaucratic resources to policy decisions, almost none have illustrated that the way state agencies actually deploy regulatory resources—policy outputs— significantly influences policy outcomes. Focusing specifically on the insurance industry in the United States, in this article we illustrate the impact of state regulatory activities on the solvency of firms in the insurance industry from 1987 to 1997, and in doing so we emphasize the differences between policy outputs and policy outcomes. In the case of policy outputs, for example, we find that elected insurance commissioners, divided state government, budgetary resources, and larger insurance sectors lead to more aggressive solvency examinations of insurers. In addition to examinations, however, we discern an important role for both regulatory and political institutions in subsequent insurer insolvencies.

2001 "Realignments and Macropartisanship." American Political Science Review 95(4):953-62. (with Michael F. Meert; Helmut Norpoth).  (download)

Aggregate party identification (macropartisanship) has exhibited substantial movement in the U.S. electorate over the last half century. We contend that a major key to that movement is a rare, massive, and enduring shift of the electoral equilibrium commonly known as a partisan realignment. The research, which is based on time-series data that employ the classic measurement of party identification, shows that the 1980 election triggered a systematic growth of Republican identification that cut deeply into the overwhelming Democratic lead dating back to the New Deal realignment. Although short-term fluctuations in macropartisanship are responsive to the elements of everyday politics, neither presidential approval nor consumer sentiment is found responsible for the 1980 shift. Realignments aside, macropartisanship is guided by a stable, not a continuously moving, equilibrium.

1999  "Institutions and Reform: Reinventing Local Government." Urban Affairs Review 34(3):433-55. (with Mark Schneider, Paul Teske & Byung-Moon Ji).  (download)

During the past few years, a new wave of reform has been launched under the rubric of reinventing government. Yet, despite the hype, little is known about the extent to which reinventing government is a reality across the country. The authors undertake a systematic analysis of reform activity in a large sample of suburban municipalities and find low rates of adoption of current reforms. Although a number of identifiable and theoretically important institutional constraints inhibit reform activity, city manager leadership appears to be critical for overcoming the impediments to efficient governance.
